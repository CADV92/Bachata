# Guest Workshop: Bachata Musicality with Pierre Henry

## Part 1: Music Theory Foundation

Musicality is a simple concept to understand, but it takes time and practice to apply it to your dancing. Be patient. It’s a journey!

* Part 1: Music Theory Foundation
* Summary of the 4 Principles:
<br><br>Timing – the ability to synchronize movement to a specific beat in the music.
<br><br>Rhythm – repetitive and predictable sequence of accents in the music. The instruments play rhythms, and we make rhythms with our bodies to match them. The basic step is a perfect example.
<br><br>Phrasing – how the song is divided up into sections and sentences that make musical sense.
<br><br>Dynamics – the ability to match the energy, texture and flavour of our movements to those of the music.

Pierre also created an incredible app, at the same website above, with a few bachata song breakdowns that shows you…

> * What section of the song you’re in
> * What rhythmical structure is being used in that section
> * The phrasing and counts
> * Separate tracks you can turn on/off for vocals and instruments

* Part 2: Bachata Music Structure
* Summary
<br><br>The five traditional instruments in bachata music are:
  * Bongo
  * Güira
  * Bass guitar
  * Lead guitar / Primero / Requinto
  * Rhythm guitar / Segundo

  <br>Every Bachata song has three components:
  * Sections (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Mambo, Outro)
  * Frameworks (Derecho, Majao, Mambo)
  * Rhythms

  <br>Each section of the song has a specific framework that tells the instruments which rhythms they can play:
  
  Section -> possible frameworks -> how to notice the section
  * Intro/Outro – no rules
  * Verse -> Derecho framework. How to notice it: the güira plays on every half beat
  * Chorus -> Derecho or Majao frameworks. How to notice it: the güira plays on every beat
  * Mambo -> Majao or Mambo frameworks. How to notice it: the guitar goes crazy

  <br>For a given section, all the instruments will follow the same framework and play a similar rhythm (either straight or syncopated), to compliment one another.

  Note: You have to be specific when you’re talking musicality. For example: “mambo” can refer to a section, framework, or a rhythm:

  * In latin music, including salsa, the “mambo section” refers to an instrumental solo where one instrument gets to show off.
  * In bachata music, during the “mambo” section the “mambo” framework can be used, which tells the instruments they can play either the majao or “mambo” rhythms
  * In bachata and merengue, both dances from the Dominican Republic, there is also a “mambo” rhythm played by the güira called “a caballo” or “on horseback” which sounds like a galloping horse.

  <br>As soon as you get into the theme of remixes, all of the above goes out the window. Why? Because the song doesn’t follow the traditional bachata sections, frameworks, and it likely won’t have all the traditional instruments – maybe just the bongo.

  Remixes that people dance bachata to that only have the bongo added to them are being called “bongochata.”

* Part 3: Using Music Structure in Dance

## Summary

* Q: can you dance bachata to different timings?

  A: It depends on your philosophy of timing and rhythm. In various parts of the world, especially Latin America, people dance bachata or salsa on any count you can think of: on 1, 2, 3 etc. It’s not necessarily wrong, but as dancers who want to be educated in musicality, there are ways to dance that make more sense with the music and ways that make less sense. For Bachata, Pierre argues dancing on 1 makes the most sense, because it lines up with the martillo rhythm of the bongo, and your steps accent the same beats as the bongo. From Pierre’s musical perspective:

  * Son should be danced on 2 (contratiempo, 2-3-4, 6-7-8)
  * Cha-Cha should be danced on 2 (1-2-3-4-&, 5-6-7-8-&-)
  * Bachata should be danced on 1 (1-2-3-tap, 5-6-7-tap)
  * Bolero should be danced on 3 (1-3-4, 5-7-8)

* Dancing to the Phrasing & Building Toward the Break

  A lot of modern bachata music has a similar structure (not always the case with traditional bachata). In modern bachata songs it’s common to find blocks/phrases of four 8 counts (4 basics), and two or more of those blocks/phrases will make up a section/larger phrase of the song.

  Within a block (4 basic steps) the energy builds up, usually something like this:

  * The first 8 is usually very plain, instruments playing basic rhythm. Energy is low – keep it simple.
  * In the second 8 the musicians add some more decorations/fills, most noticeable in the güira and bongos. Energy is still low. You can add some footwork to match the decorations.
  * In the third 8 the energy begins to rise. Bring up your energy but don’t go crazy.
  * In the fourth 8 the music peaks. The energy is similar to the third 8 but with more accents. If this is the last 8 of a section you can expect a break.
  
  Example with dancing (song: lloro lloro – xtreme):

  * First 8: box step
  * Second 8: box step with triple step
  * Third 8: campana step
  * Fourth 8: 1/2 campana step + syncopated campana step to hit accents

<br>

* Musicality in Partnerwork: Shared Rhythm & Freedom of Expression
  
  When dancing with your partner, the lead needs to maintain the integrity of the basic step. This gives you a shared sense of rhythm:

  1. Ensuring the follow knows what step you’re doing
  2. Ensuring the follow knows what foot to step on (you’re both on the same time)
  3. Allowing both the lead and follow to have freedom of expression within the basic step, to add their own decorations

  <br>If the lead stops stepping, the follow has no choice but to stop stepping. And from there the lead must tell the follow exactly what to do. Think: sensual movements, body rolls, isolations etc.

  But, once the lead initiates the basic step, the follow then has the freedom to play within that basic rhythm and add her own flavour, decorations etc.

* Put Your Footwork and Sensual Moves at the End of the Phrase
  
  When you’re doing something beyond the basic step, you want to put them where it makes sense: at the end of a phrase or the end of a section, like the musicians do with their decorations and punctuation (breaks).

* Think of Your Body in Two Parts
  
  Your feet are the percussion that keep the rhythm and everything on time.

  Your upper body plays with the melodic parts of the music.

* Shift your energy throughout the song
  
  * Intro: nice and chill, get to know your partner.
  * Verse: the singer is telling us the story. Shut up and listen. Keep a relaxed energy. Don’t try and outshine the singer or band.
  * Chorus: join in with the band and raise the energy.
  * Mambo: the guitarist is going crazy and so can you. This is where you can bring in your crazy footwork. Keep a loose hold to give your partner room for expression.
