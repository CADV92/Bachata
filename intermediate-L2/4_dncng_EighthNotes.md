# Dancing to Eighth Notes (Syncopations)

## Demo, Steps & Rhythms With Syncopations

Now that we’ve covered whole notes and half notes, it’s time for eighth notes.

**Music theory review:**

> * A measure of music has 4 beats
> * An eighth note uses an eighth of the measure, so there’s 8 of them within 4 beats.
> * 1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&

**The easiest way to think of eighth notes as a dancer** is that they’re syncopations. That means you step on each beat AND the “&’s” in-between them:

**1-&-2-&-3-&-4-&-5-&-6-7-&-8-&** (you step 16 times within 8 beats)

These eighth notes, or syncopations, can be used for the whole 8 count, but they’re often used in just part of an 8 count to create cool new rhythms for your feet. Let’s take a look…
