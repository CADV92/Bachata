## Demo, Steps & Body Movement for Whole Notes

Now that’ve got your basic music theory lesson, let’s see how whole notes translate into dancing.

**Music theory review:**

> * A “measure” or “bar” of bachata music has 4 beats
> * It’s called a “whole” note because you use the WHOLE measure of music, 4 beats.

**How to think about whole notes for dancing:**

> * Whole notes use 4 beats total
> * Your basic uses 8 beats, so that’s half of your basic
> * Initiate on the 1 or the 5 (the first beat) and hold for the 3 remaining beats (4 beats total)
