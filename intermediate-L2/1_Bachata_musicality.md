# Introduction to Bachata Musicality

## Bachata Instruments

Welcome to bachata musicality!

With Regan’s background playing violin and Harold’s cultural Cuban roots, you’re in for a real treat.

In this lesson we’ll walk you through the instruments you’ll hear in bachata music, explain the song structure, the relationship between the instruments and parts of the song, as well as an overview of notes and basic music theory.

Let’s go!

## Bachata Song Structure

**Bachata Song Structure**

**Song 1**: [Durmiendo Solo – Antony Santos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltvrnB3WumA)
**Song 2**: [Confiésale – Dani J](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRhGMCYvWQ4)

**Note**: The “J” in the Spanish word “Majao” is pronounced like an English “H”.

## The Relationship Between Instruments & Song Structure

Let’s get into the relationship between the instruments and song structure.

In this video You’re going to hear Harold use the Spanish word “descarga,” which refers to a solo.

**Bongó** – typically hits 1-&-2-&-3-&-4-& (eighth notes), but can also just hit 1-2-3-4 (quarter notes) depending on part of the song, or the song itself.

**Güira** – typically hits 1-&-2-&-3-&-4-& (eighth notes) during the Derecho and 1-2-3-4 (quarter notes) during the Majao and Mambo sections

**Lead Guitar (Requinto)** – leads the melody through the song, and often gets a solo in the Mambo section.

**Rhythm Guitar (Segunda)** – an acoustic guitar that follows the bass and fills in the rhythm.

**Bass (Bajo) Guitar** –  the soul of the song, it creates the groove by emphasizing 1-&-3-4.

## The Bachata Rhythm

**Key Ideas**: musicians count in 4’s and dancers count in 8’s. A “measure” or “bar” of bachata music has 4 beats (quarter notes). Therefore, it takes two measures/bars of music to complete a dancer’s count of 8.

In other words, each half of the bachata basic is a measure of music!

## Musical Notes Overview

**Whole Notes**

A whole note is held for 4 beats (quarter notes).

Note: In the video below, there is no instrument actually playing or holding this whole note. Regan is simply using her finger to show the difference between the timing of a whole note vs. a quarter note.

**Half Notes**

A Half Note is held for 2 beats (quarter notes)

**Eighth Notes**

An eighth note is half a beat (quarter note). These are often referred to as “syncopations”

**Bass Beat**

This is the rhythm played by the bass guitar (bajo), creating the soul of the song.

Note: it’s very hard to hear the low sound of the bass guitar in this video. Play a bachata song on a good sound system to listen for it. [Check out this video clip](https://youtu.be/7_-sNrzEHl0?t=1:00) to hear what the bass sounds like and watch this rhythm being played, so you can begin identifying it.
