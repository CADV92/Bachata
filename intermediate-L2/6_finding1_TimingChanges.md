# Finding the 1 & Timing Changes

## How to Listen to a Song and Find the 1

If you’re lucky, you may have an ear that’s already tuned to the music and be able to find the 1, but MOST people need to specifically practice this skill to develop it. So don’t worry, you’re not alone!

Also, go easy on yourself. Training your ear to find the 1 takes time!

**Tip**: The more bachata music you listen to, the faster you’ll get comfortable with it.

<br>Regan is going to ask you to listen to specific instruments and there’s one that’s VERY difficult to hear in this video, since it’s the lowest layer of music – the Bass Guitar. To practice hearing it, click the song link below and play it on the best quality speakers you have.

* Summary for finding the 1
  * The long note of the Bass Guitar starts on the 1 and 5
  * The lead guitar (Requinto) plays the melody and those melodic phrases begin on the 1
  * The lead vocalist’s voice often starts on and emphasizes the 1, but not always!
  * The low strike of the bongo comes just before the 1 and the 5

## Timing Changes

* Timing Changes
<br><br>**Remember**: musicians count in 4’s while dancers count in 8’s.
<br><br>When musicians compose music they’re not thinking about dancers. So when they add an extra bar of 4 beats here and there, as a stylistic choice, it ends up switching the timing for us – we start stepping on the 5 instead of the 1.
<br><br>**Final note**: nobody is expected to know when timing changes are going to happen. The important part is being able to identify, ‘Oh, the timing changed… let me get back on the 1.’
