# Dancing to Half Notes

## Demo & Steps for Half Notes

Now that you understand whole notes, let’s learn how to apply half notes into your dancing.

**Music theory review:**

A “measure” or “bar” of bachata music has 4 beats
It’s called a “half” note because it uses HALF the beats in the measure, 2 beats.

**How to think about half notes for dancing:**

Half notes use 2 beats total
Step on the first beat, hold the second beat (and repeat).
Step on 1-3-5-7
They’re also called “**quarter beats**” because within 8 beats (a whole basic) you step 4 times. In our salsa program Patrick & Scarlet call them “**core beats**,” which means the same thing.
