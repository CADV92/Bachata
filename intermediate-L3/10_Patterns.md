## Lean, Dip, Roll

This pattern brings together the following new skills you learned in this module so you can get some good repetition in:

> * Off-Center Leans
> * Body Rolls Using Levels
> * Full Upper Body Dips
> * Turn Your Back
> * Chest Isolations, and
> * The Famous Dip

Use this pattern as is, or break it up into any parts you like for your social dancing – this one’s less about a cool flow, and more about practicing the individual elements.
