## Tips for the Famous Dip

The biggest mistake people make is turning the famous dip into the famous fall ðŸ¤£ byâ€¦

1) The lead leaning forward and going off balance, causing you both people to fall

2) The follow throwing herself backwards instead of holding her own weight, especially when the lead isnâ€™t ready to catch her. The lead shouldnâ€™t have to catch all the followâ€™s weight, but he should always be ready to!
