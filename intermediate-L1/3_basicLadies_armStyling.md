# Some Basic Ladies' Arm Styling Options

## Demo & Ladies’ Arm Styling Options

Alright ladies, now that you’re improving how you step and move your hips and torso, here are a few options to style your arms in your various basics.

**Pro Tip**: styling is an aesthetic extension of body movement. It all starts with your steps and weight shifts. From there your movement comes through your core and outward towards your arms.  “Styling” isn’t something that looks nice on it’s own. It will only look natural and beautiful when layered on top of quality body movement. If you find yourself struggling, focus on creating a strong foundation of movement first (steps, weight shifts, hips and chest) and then add these aesthetics touches.
