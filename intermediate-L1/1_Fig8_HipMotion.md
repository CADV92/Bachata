# Adding Figure 8 Hip Motion to Your Basic

## Figure 8 Explanation

Intermediate Level 1 is all about improving your quality of movement and understanding music. Both of these skills require lots of practice, but they’re easily the most rewarding in the end.

When you improve your ability to move and understand your body you gain the prerequisite skills to become more musical. Getting comfortable with how you move and learning to connect that movement to music is the next step toward more deeply, and spontaneously, expressing yourself to the songs you hear. And that freedom of expression feels incredible!

**Remember**: At first your movement will feel robotic, and there’s a large spectrum between feeling robotic and fluid. Keep practicing each day and the fluidity will come, making your movements feel more natural.
