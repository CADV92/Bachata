# Adding Arm Movements in Your Basic

## Creating Natural Arm Movement

You’ve learned your basic step with proper weight shifts and taps, and now it’s time to learn what to do with your arms!

Don’t worry if you feel awkward at first, it’s all a process of getting used to your body and how it moves. It takes practice to improve coordination.

Remember this: arm movements COME from your weight shifts. As you shift your weight, your arms naturally swing. All we’re doing is taking that natural movement and shaping it. Try not to fabricate un-natural movement.
