# Patterns for Practice

## Roll With Me

Now that you’ve learned 3 types of body rolls it’s party time! Let’s see what we can do with them and give you a little combo you can take to the dance floor.

This combo uses the Front Body Roll, Side Body Roll (From Shoulder) and Side to Side Body Roll.

**Remember**: when social dancing, you can use this whole pattern as it is, or just use pieces of it. There are no rules. For an extra challenge try mixing up the parts of the pattern or creating your own. Exploring the concepts you know is the best way to engrain them and improve!

## Wrap N Roll

For “Wrap N Roll” we’re going to take EVERYTHING from the previous levels and combine it into a pattern for you.

Moves in this pattern:

> Outside Turn for Follow
> <br>Side Body Roll (From Shoulder)
> <br>Side to Side Body Roll
> <br>Wrap
> <br>Arm Options in Your Basic

**Remember**: There’s an endless way to combine even the relatively small amount of moves you’ve learned so far–especially when you let the music guide you–so don’t just learn this combo and stop there. Use what you know and start making mini combos of your own. If you do this, you will at least triple the speed of your progress.
