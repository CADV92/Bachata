# The Concept of Free Spinning

## Demo, Review & Hook Turns

Once you learn most of the individual steps and elements of bachata and begin advancing, the next step is to learn concepts which can be applied to the vocabulary you know.

Free spinning is one of those concepts. And in this lesson we’re going to show you how to apply it to a few of the turns you already know, and then give you a pattern for practice. These are the turns we’ll use:

> * Right and Left Turns with a Partner
> * Twist and Turn
> * Hook turn (new, in this lesson)

Keep in mind: You can apply the concept of free spinning to any turns you do!
