# Patterns for Practice

## New Recruit

The idea of these combos is to take everything you’ve learned and put it together into a pattern you can do when you out social dancing.

**Leads**: the key thing to remember is that YOU can make your own combos using what you know. Don’t just rely on your teachers to give you ideas. Whenever you learn a new move practice it, explore it and then add it to a combination you already know or create something new. This process will make you improve 10x faster! Plus, you’ll have so much more you can use when you go out dancing.

**Follows**: even if you think you know what the lead is going to do (especially when you’re learning combos together) don’t guess or “back-lead”! Surrender to your partner and make sure the leader has to LEAD you to do the movement – don’t “help” your partner, but do give constructive feedback afterward based on how it felt.

Extra challenge: once you get this combo down, try mixing Parts 1-3 into a different order.
