# Let's Learn How to Change Places

## Cross Body

It’s time to learn how to change places with your partner.

To do this we’re borrowing a move that looks likes the cross body lead from salsa. Leads will open the door on the 1 for the follows to cross to the other side.

## Cross Body (Cross on 1)

In this variation of the Cross Body you share the center (the mid point between you two) and start by both stepping forward to cross beside one another.

## Double Cross Body

In this variation of the **Cross Body** we’re going to change places two times in a row.

Think of this move in two halves: the first half starts on 1 and the second half starts on 5.

Note: If you’d like, you can skip the first cross body on 1, do half a basic instead, and then just do the cross body that starts on 5.

## Double Cross Body (Cross on 1)

Remember the **Cross Body (Cross on 1)**? This is the same but with a Double Cross Body.

Think of this move in two halves: the first half starts on 1 and the second half starts on 5.

Note: If you like, you could completely forget about doing the first cross on 1, do half a basic instead, and then just do the cross that starts on 5.

* Lead and Follow
<br>At 0:49 in the video Regan mentions “back leading.” Back leading is when the follow stops following and tries to force something, in essence leading the leader.
