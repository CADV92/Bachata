# Doing Your Mini Combos With a Partner

## Demo & Mini Combos With a Partner

Let’s take those 3 Mini Combos of Basics you learned and add a partner to get more practice. Don’t worry about trying to link them all together right away. Get comfortable with each combo on its own first and then put them together.

Extra challenge: once you can do the combos in the order we’ve given you, try making your own pattern using the new basics you’ve learned. That’s what social dancing is about after all – creating and expressing yourself in the moment!
