# Patterns for Practice

## Hands Up
“Hands Up” pulls everything you’ve learned in this level together, so you can take it to the dance floor:

> 3 New Basics – Mini Combos With a Partner
> <br>Options for Your Tap
> <br>Arm Options for Your Basic

Extra challenge: remember, simply repeating the combos we show you like a robot isn’t the best way to improve. It’s completely fine to do that, but if you want to deepen your understanding of concepts and seriously improve your bachata, start remixing and exploring these ideas for yourself and make your own patterns – start super simple!

## Driving Test

In this combo we’re going to focus again on EVERYTHING you’ve learned in this level, combining it all into a fun combo you can do with your partners.

The skills we’ll use are:

> Angled Walks with a Partner
> <br>Front, Side & Back Basics with a Partner
> <br>Arm Options for your Basic
> <br>Options for your Tap

**Extra challenge**: take the moves from this combo and re-order them to make something new. After that, take all the ideas you’ve learned so far (basics, turns, angles, kicks, drops) and make some mini combos of your own. Creating and exploring is the best way to improve – and you don’t even need a parter!
