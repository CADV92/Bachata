# Traveling at Angles With a Partner

## Demo & Front/Back/Side V’s

It’s time to add a partner into the mix and practice your angled walks. We’ll be using the concept of angled walks to create three shapes (patterns) in this lesson:

> * Front V
> * Back V
> * Side V

Remember to keep that slight compression in your hands so you can read each other!

**Extra challenge**: try making your own pattern of angled walks.

**Pro tip**: you don’t always have to come back to the centre, you can keep traveling forward or backward or any direction you like!
